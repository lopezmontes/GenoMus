	Abstract = {This paper presents a framework being developed to clarify discussion of algorithmic musical processes.  We will firstly present some of the current terminological problems then discuss related research and background concepts.  Following this, two principal attributes that enable intuitive comparison of algorithmic compositional processes will be defined in detail.  The framework will then be demonstrated by applying it to some representative examples of differing algorithmic music systems.},
