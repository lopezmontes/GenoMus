\begin{abstract}

 	
We present GenoMus, a new model for artificial musical creativity based on a procedural approach, able to represent and learn compositional techniques behind a musical score. The aim of this model is to build a framework for automatic creativity, easily adaptable to other domains beyond music. The core of GenoMus is a functional grammar designed to cover a wide range of styles, integrating traditional and contemporary composing techniques. In its encoded form, both composing methods and music scores are represented as unidimensional normalized arrays. On the other hand, the decoded form of GenoMus grammar is human-readable, allowing manual edition and the implementation of user-defined processes. Musical procedures (\emph{genotypes}) are defined as functional trees, able to generate musical scores (\emph{phenotypes}). Each subprocess uses the same generic functional structure, no matter what time scale, polyphonic structure, traditional or algorithmic process is being employed. The goal of this highly homogeneous and modular approach is to simplify metaprogramming and to maximize search space. This abstract and compact representation of musical knowledge as pure numeric arrays is designed for a convenient application to different machine learning paradigms.

Research in artificial musical intelligence demand for formalized
grammars of musical structures. {\color{gray} \textsl{[introducir cita, y hablar en el background de gramÃ¡ticas generativas]}} Besides, a model of creative
mind is required to operate these abstractions.
Aesthetic criteria are extremely subjective, furthermore the details
of every model of automatic composition impose, consciously
or not, a limited search space. Delimiting these
boundaries and setting evaluation principles can be seen as
metacomposition, namely composing composers.

Composers' interest in musical language pervaded the 20th
century aesthetics. Transformation and overcoming of well-established methods
inherited from Romanticism led to post-tonal
music. Linguistic structuralism applied to musical
syntax stimulated relativization and consciousness of
compositional procedures. Reversing the logic of this analytic knowledge, the methods
of serial dodecaphonic music was the first step for the foundations of
an inverse creative strategy: synthesize new styles from the predefinition of new rules. 

Computer assisted composition enabled
far more complex procedures, tedious or unfeasible to explore by hand. Eventually, composers began to use computers not only for analysis and calculation of complex structures, but for the automation of the creative processes themselves. That fact opened the door to a new approach to composition: a metamusical level characterized by modeling the processes within the minds of composers.

This proposal, beyond the technical details, is a model of augmented creativity from the point of view of the composer. The new paradigm of computation applied to creative tasks is tilting from ordering to the computer "what to do", to saying "what to get", as a starting point to detonate supervised or non-supervised creative processes. So, the goal of GenoMus is to combine a knowledge base of compositional procedures with the maximal freedom of recombination.

Over the last decades, a plethora of grammars {\color{red}(citarlas)} to represent music have been proposed. This framework...  

After studying the potential and limitations of previous research {\color{red}(referencia)}, and based on the experience of several iterations of the core concept, the GenoMus grammar has been designed to satisfy these key features {\color{red}justificar con referencias de donde se extrae estas conclusiones de que sean key features)}:

{\color{red}Ahora mismo, hay una mezcla de niveles de abstraccion; por ejemplo, 'a', 'g' o 'j' son caracteristicas, mientras que 'd' dice como se debe de hacer.}

{\color{red}Mi propuesta simplificada de caracteristicas:

- Representacion modular.

- Representacion compacta (es menor o igual que el resultado que codifica).

- Representacion extensible (se pueden usar subconjuntos de la gramatica)

- Representacion manipulable procedimentalmente.

- Representacion consistente (un codigo siempre genera la misma salida)

- Soporte para autoreferencias internas.

- Aplicabilidad a otros contexto.
}

\textbf{a) Grammar based on a symbolic and generative approach to music composition and analysis.}

GenoMus is focused on the correspondences between compositional procedures as musical results. It employs the genotype/phenotype metaphor, as many other similar approaches, but in a specific way, discussed below.

\textbf{b) Style-independent grammar, but able to incorporate complex processes from contemporary techniques.} 

In any approach to artificial creativity, a representation system is a precondition that restricts the search space and imposes aesthetic biases a priori, either consciously or unconsciously. The design of algorithms to generate music can be ultimately seen as an act of composition itself. With this in mind, our proposal seeks to be as open and generic as possible, to represent virtually any style and enclose any procedure. The purpose of the project is not to imitate styles, but to create results of certain originality, worthy of being qualified as \emph{creative}. 

A smooth integration of modern and traditional techniques is one of the purposes of our grammar. GenoMus allows to include any compositional procedure, even those from generative techniques that imply iterative subprocesses, such as recursive formulas, automata, chaos, constraint-based and heuristic searches, L-systems, etc. 

\textbf{c) Optimized modularity for metaprogramming.}

Each musical excerpt is generated by a function tree made with a palette of procedures attending all dimensions: events, motifs, rhythmic and harmonic structures, poliphony, global form, etc. All function categories share the same input/output data structure, which ease the implementation of metaprogramming routines encompassing all time scales and polyphonic layers of a composition.

\textbf{d) Identical encoded representation of both compositional procedures and musical scores as single unidimensional and normalized vectors.}

Compared to similar grammars, this is the distinctive feature of GenoMus. Functional expressions and the results of their evaluations are both encoded as sequences of floats within the interval $[0, 1]$. Thus, pairs of complex nested procedures and their corresponding complex polyphonic scores are mapped as flattened unidimensional arrays. This abstract representation of music is suitable to be handled with different machine learning techniques. 

\textbf{e) Alternative decoded format of compositional procedures, as function trees easily understandable and manually editable.}

Functional expressions and their encoded format are alternative representations. So, the abstract vectorial format can be converted into a readable and editable text with convenient numeric scales for each parameter.

\textbf{f) Representation of music able to capture all time scales and polyphonic layers, from expressive details to global form.} 

The aesthetic potential of computer generated artworks is often obscure, especially when there are aspirations to find original styles and new rules. Human composers usually conceive sequences of notes, agogics, articulation gestures and dynamic expressiveness as a whole. There is no intrinsic value in a sequence of durations and pitches if it lacks of expressive attributes such as articulation and dynamics. Interrelations of different parameters, both in short and long term, are critical to get appealing results.

A good piece of music is much more of than the sum of its parts.\footnote{Beethoven perfectly exemplifies how sublime and huge musical structures can emerge from trivial and seemingly uninteresting musical motifs.} Composers often construct a piece by planning interrelations between the details of motifs and the overall structure. This holistic conception of creativity have been obviated in many previous research focused on particular compositional tasks. So, in our framework macro and microformal features are created and transformed as an entire entity from the beginning of the transformational operations.

Preliminar experiments with GenoMus showed that many of the randomly generated musical excerpts exhibited surprising expressive qualities: an interesting dynamic gesture can create a feeling of order and purpose when applied to sequences of notes that otherwise could be assessed as meaningless or too random. So, to discover potential combinations, our framework fuses the generation of completely developed excerpts with the incremental transformation of the details of any element inside them.

\textbf{g) Support for internal autoreferences.}

In almost any composition, some essential procedures require the reuse of   previously heard patterns. As many pieces consist of transformations and derivations of motifs presented at the very beginning, our framework enables pointing to preceding patterns. At execution time, each subexpression is stored and indexed, being available to be referenced by the following functions of the evaluation chain.

Beyond the benefits of avoiding internal redundancy when there are repeated patterns, the possibility of create internal autorefences of nodes inside a function tree is an indispensable precondition for the inclusion of procedures which demand recursion, reevaluation of subexpressions.


\textbf{h) Consistency of the correspondences among procedures and musical outputs}

To get an increasing knowledge base, correspondences between expressions, encoded representations and resulting music must be always the same, regardless of the subsequent evolution of the grammar and the progressive addition of new procedures by different users.

For encoding musical procedures, each function name maps to a number. But in order to keep the encoded vectors as different as possible, function name indexes are scattered across the interval $[0, 1]$ and registered in a library containing all available functions.


\textbf{i) Possibility of generating music using subsets of the complete library of compositional procedures.}

Before the automatic composition process begins, it can be selected which specific procedures should be included or excluded from it. It can also be defined mandatory functions to be used in all the results proposed by the algorithm.

\textbf{j) Applicability to other creative disciplines beyond music.}

Although this framework is presented for the automatic composition of music, the model can be easily adaptable to other areas where creative solutions are sought. Whenever it is possible to decompose a result into nested procedures, a library of such procedures can be created that takes advantage of their encoding as numerical vectors that serve as input data for machine learning algorithms.

\subsection{Knowledge representation}
% Genotypes, phenotypes, species and specimens
Although its target is not only genetic algorithms but a variety of machine learning techniques, our framework uses the evolutionary analogy, similarly as many other automatic composition systems \cite{Sulyok2019, SnchezQuintana2013, add more...}. The Darwinian metaphor can be confusing, since each system has its particular application of the same terms, sometimes denoting even opposite concepts. 

In our functional approach, the key idea is \emph{considering a piece of music as the product of a program} which encloses compositional procedures. Thereupon, the bio-inspired terms in the context of the GenoMus framework are defined as follows: 


\begin{description}
\item[genotype:] Computable tree of compositional procedures.
\item[genotype function:] Minimal computable unit of a genotype, designed in a modular way to enable taking other genotype functions as arguments. 
\item[decoded genotype:] Genotype coded as a readable, understandable and evaluable string.
\item[encoded genotype:] Genotype coded as an array of floats $\in [0, 1]$.
\item[phenotype:] Music generated by a genotype.
\item[encoded phenotype:] Phenotype coded as an array of floats $\in [0, 1]$.
\item[decoded phenotype:] Phenotype converted to a format suitable for third-party music software.
\end{description}

The {genotype}, in its decoded format, is actually a computable expression. Consequently, the automatic writing and manipulation of genotypes can be seen as a metaprogramming process.

The {phenotype}, as the product of the evaluation of the functional expression content in a genotype, is a sequence of sonic events declared in a format designed to encode music according to a hierarchical structure, made by combining these three formal categories:

\begin{description}
\item[event:] Single sonic element. An event is a wrapper for a sequence of numeric parameters.
\item[voice:] Line (or layer) of music. A voice is a wrapper for a sequence of one or more events, or a wrapper for one or more voices sequentially concatenated, without overlapping.
\item[score:] Piece (or passage) of music. A score can be a wrapper for one or more voices, or a wrapper for one or more scores together. Scores can be concatenated sequentially (one after another) or simultaneously (sounding together).
\end{description}

Depending on the final desired output of the generative process, a different parametric structure will be expected for a event. Hence, to allow diverse formats for decoded phenotypes, two more concepts arise:  

\begin{description}
\item[species:] Specific configuration of the internal structure of parameters required to construct an event.
\item[specimen:] A genotype/phenotype pair belonging to a species, that produces a piece of music. A specimen data are content in a dictionary along with metadata and additional analytical informations.
\end{description}


Continuing with the biological analogy, a {species} can be alternatively defined as the group of specimens that share the same parameter structure of their musical events. The species called \emph{piano}, used in the examples, requires four attributes for each event: duration, pitch, articulation and intensity. 

A {parameter} required by a event can be a single value or an array of values (a {multiparameter}). For instance, in the piano species, an event can contain more than one pitch, to work with chords.

Events build with many parameters can be set. For instance, a species for a very specific electroacoustic setup could need events defined by dozens of features.\footnote{A preliminar test of a species for complex sound synthesis and spatialization where used for the composition of the piece \emph{Microcontrapunctus} \cite{microcontrapunctus}.} An event specification can also be extended to other domains beyond music, like visuals, lighting, etc., along with musical events, or standalone.

\subsection{Formal definition of the GenoMus framework}\label{sec:formaldef}

A GenoMus framework for a species $s$ is defined as the 10-tuple $G_s = \{P, \vec{e}, T, i, F, E, L, M, C, \vec{d}\}$, where

\begin{itemize}
\item $P$ is the set of parameter types necessary to represent the dimensions of an event.
\item $\vec{e}$ is the vector of ordered parameter types $\in P$ specifying the format of an event. 
\item $T$ is the set of genotype function types. 
\item $i \in T$ is the function type required to init a genotype first node.
\item $F$ is the set of all genotype functions registered in a specific library for species $s$.
\item $E \subset F$ is the set of eligible functions selected to build genotypes.
\item $L$ is the set of leaf types employed as genotype terminal nodes.
\item $M$ is the set of conversion functions mapping specific formats of any parameter type $\in P$ into real numbers $\in [0,1]$, and their correspondent inverse functions.
\item $C$ is the pair of an encoding function to transform genotype functions trees into unidimensional vectors of reals $\in [0,1]$, and its inverse function.
\item $\vec{d}$ is a generic data structure to be taken as input or returned as output by any function $\in F$.
\end{itemize}

The data content in $\vec{d}$ has the form of a dictionary (actually a JavaScript Object in our implementation), including this properties:

\begin{description}
\item[\texttt{funcType}:] Function type according to its output.
\item[\texttt{encGen}:] Encoded genotype. 
\item[\texttt{decGen}:] Decoded genotype (the function's own expression as a string).
\item[\texttt{encPhen}:] Encoded phenotype of the generated score.
\item[\texttt{phenVoices}:] Number of voices of the generated score
\item[\texttt{phenLength}:] Number of events of the generated score
\item[(\emph{others}):] Additional information, generally related to a self-analysis of musical features that are useful for the next genotype node, such as tempo, rhythm, harmony, etc.

\end{description}

This data structure is what each genotype function expects for every argument, and what is passed to the next one. A crucial item is \textbf{decGen}, where a function returns its own code as a string. It allows reevaluations of this code, which is essential to procedures involving iteration, recursion or stochastic processes.

The decoding of GenoMus encoded phenotypes into standard formats for any musical application can be seen as an external operation, not concerning directly this formal definition.

Let G be the set of all possible valid encoded genotypes. To create genotypes, the map $f$ works as a decision tree such as every vector $\vec{p} = (p_1, p_2, ..., p_n) \in P^n$ will be mapped to $G$: 
$$f:\ P^n\to G$$
Most of times $n$ doesn't match the number of required items to complete a valid encoded genotype. If $\vec{p}$ has more items than needed, they are ignored. If $f$ needs more items than those supplied by $\vec{p}$, $f$ reads $\vec{p}$ repeatedly from the beginning as a loop, until closing the valid encoded genotype. That implies that even vectors with a single value can be mapped to large functional expressions.

To illustrate how GenoMus represents and encodes a piece of music using basic procedures in an abstract format, we will apply the framework to model \emph{Clapping Music}, a famous piece composed by Steve Reich in 1972. As many of the pieces of the composer, it begins with a minimal motif, which undergoes simple transformations that have big consequences in the overall form. Two performers start the piece repeating a clapped pattern. One of the performers removes the first note of the pattern after each cycle of 8 repetitions\footnote{According to the score, each loop can consist of 8 or 12 repetitions. We have chosen 8 repetitions for the sake of clarity and because is the preferred version for most of recordings.}, creating a phase shift among both voices. The work finished when both lines are in phase again.

The piece was modeled using the \emph{piano} species which, according to the formalism stated in section~\ref{sec:formaldef}, is defined as the set $G_{piano} = \{P, \vec{e}, T, i, F_{piano}, E, L, M, C, \vec{d}\}$, where

\begin{itemize}
\item $P = \{notevalue, midipitch, articulation, intensity, quantized, ...\}$\hfill[parameter types]
\item $\vec{e} = (notevalue, midipitch, articulation, intensity)$\hfill[event format] 
\item $T = \{scoreF, voiceF, quantizedF, lnotevalueF, lmidipitchF, ...\}$\hfill[genotype function types] 
\item $i = scoreF$\hfill[genotype function type for first node]
\item $F_{piano}$ is the set of all genotype functions registered in the specific library for the $piano$ spieces.
\item $E = \{s2V, vSlice, vRepeatV, vConcatV, cMotifLoop, vAutoref, ln, lm, la, li, q\}$\hfill[eligible functions]
\item $L = \{lnotevalueLeaf, lmidipitchLeaf, larticulationLeaf, lintensityLeaf, quantizedLeaf\}$\hfill[leaves]
\item $M = \{norm2notevalue, notevalue2norm, norm2midipitch, ...\}$\hfill[conversion functions]
\item $C = \{encodeGenotype, decodeGenotype\}$\hfill[encoding/decoding functions]
\item $\vec{d}$ is the data structure to serve as inputs and outputs for all functions $\in F_{piano}$.
\end{itemize}


Based on this architecture, there exist several ways to model the piece, since its patterns can be obtained by different methods.\footnote{Comparing different ways of generating this work is an interesting question beyond this paper's scope. Each model can correspond to alternative manners of perceiving structural aspects. A different analysis and procedural model of \emph{Clapping Music} can be found in \cite{MPS-manual}. To create our model, we looked for the concisest code assembling simple and generic operations.} The Figure~\ref{fig:clappingstruct} shows the score and one of the possible analytical deconstructions in patterns.

\end{figure}

Our model derivates the whole composition from transformations of the first four notes (motif $A$), appling five generic operations using the genotype functions explained in Table~\ref{table:funcs}. The remaining functions are mere containers for different parameter types.

Our framework has been implemented by using JavaScript for the core code, and Max\footnote{\url{https://www.cycling74.com}} with its bach\footnote{\url{https://www.bachproject.net}} package to interact in realtime with the results of the generative processes. The complete work was recreated by the decoded genotype displayed in Listing~\ref{lst:clapgeno}. The uppercase letters in the comments refer to the patterns analyzed in Figure~\ref{fig:clappingstruct}.

\begin{lstlisting}[floatplacement=H, language=Java, caption={Decoded genotype of \emph{Clapping Music} model.}, label={lst:clapgeno}]

              li(60,60,90,0)), // intensities (last note louder for clarity) 
            vSlice(            // motif B: A with 1st note sliced
              vAutoref(0),
              q(1))),
          vSlice(              // motif D: C with first two notes sliced
            vAutoref(3),
            q(2))),
        q(8)),
      q(13)),
    q(-12)),
  vConcatV(                    // voice K: F + H
    vAutoref(7),
    vRepeatV(                  // phase I: H 12 times 
      vSlice(                  // cycle H: F without 1st note, for phase shift
        vAutoref(10),
        q(1)),
      q(12))))
\end{lstlisting}

The arguments of the \texttt{vAutoref} functions refers to a list of subexpressions stored and updated after the evaluation of each genotype function. An autoreference can refers only to the available subexpressions indexed at the moment of its evaluation. That implies that in the constructive process a function will only reuse previous material of the musical timeline. This reflects how works the perception and memory of music, establishing interrelations with preceding elements.

To clarify the autoreferences inside the genotype, Table~\ref{table:subexp} enumerate all the subexpressions stored at the end of the genotype evaluation. Only the subexpressions for \emph{voiceF} function type are showed, although there exist for all categories. Autoreferences can refer to foregoing autoreferences, as ocurred at line 25, where \texttt{vAutoref(10)} points to \texttt{vAutoref(7)}, which in turn points to a subexpression that contains two more autoreferences.

The Figure~\ref{fig:claptree} displays the functional tree of this decoded genotype, along with its internal autoreferences. The tree is represented in inverse order, from left to right, to reflect how substructures are feeding to subsequent functions which construct larger musical patterns, as well as the subexpressions indexing order.

  \caption{Functional tree of \emph{Clapping Music} genotype.}
  \label{fig:claptree}
\end{figure}

The encoded genotype is an unidimensional numeric vector. To get a better insight into the correspondences between procedures and music results, we visualize arrays of floats as rows of segments: lengths correspond to values within interval $[0,1]$; colors are mapped to distinguish slight differences among very similar values, so the patterns have a distinctive visual identity. The encoded phenotype of our \emph{Clapping Music} model consist of 117 values. Figure~\ref{fig:boat3} shows the visualization of this abstract representation of the composition.

\end{figure}

The genotype of a whole composition like this (or only part of it) can be automatically flattened to create a new genotype function where all leaves are assembled as a single array of arguments\footnote{The numeric values that feed arguments for the autoreferences are excluded from the arguments array of the new derivate function because of their structural character. These number must be immutable to preserve the internal consistency of the procedure.}.  For instance, a new function called \texttt{sClapping} could be created to be handled as a new procedure, abstracted from the original piece:

\textsl{Edward Fredkin suggested to me the theory that listening to music might exercise some innate map-making mechanism in the brain. When I mentioned the puzzle of music's repetitiousness, he compared it to the way rodents explore new places: first they go one way a little, then back to home. They do it again a few times, then go a little farther. They try small digressions, but frequently return to base. Both people and mice explore new territories that way, making mental maps lest they get lost. Music might portray this building process, or even exercise those very parts of the mind.}

When modeling artistic creativity with algorithms, probably the most evasive issue to address is programming fitness functions. By definition, the assessment of a piece of art can only be made from a subjective point of view, since the goal of art is to provoke inner and personal reactions. These individual responses are very dependent on cultural and social context. However, provided enough data some predictions can be made about the expected rating for a new piece.

In GenoMus, we divide evaluation of each specimen in two categories:

\begin{itemize}
\item Autoanalytic profile: objective analysis of a set of musical features, such as variability, rhythmic complelxity, tonal stability, global dissonance index, level of inner autoreference, etc. 
\item Human evaluations: subjective ratings made by human users, attending to aesthetic value, originality, mood and emotional intensity. This informations are stored individually and together as global statistics.

\end{itemize}

The self-analysis contained in every specimen allows to measure distance and similaritiy to  
other specimens, as well as to classify results and to drive evolution processes.

Defining how to evaluate and select results is now the most creative effort, and can be identified with the act of composition itself, since composing music is ultimately making choices.

\item Esta propuesta de gramatica posibilita la implementacion y competencia de diferentes sistemas de evaluacion
\item Design of evaluation methods as the crucial act of composition
\item Objective vs. subjective evaluation
\item What to learn?
\item Evolutionary paradigm as the most promising
\end{itemize}


}


\subsection{Evolutionary paradigm}

Determining how to evolve and mutate an specimen towards a best version is crucial question too. Starting from a simple motif, endless evolution paths can lead to satisfying results based on heuristic approaches, using accumulated knowledge from examples, human ratings and automatic self-analysis.

The GenoMus grammar is designed to favor the broadest diversity of combinations and transformations. Genetic algorithms are suitable for the automation of an incremental exploration and selection of multiple ways. A GenoMus decoded genotype tree expression can be trasnformed using these methods:

\begin{itemize}
\item createGen
\item mutateLeaves
\item growTrunk
\item growBranch
\item insertBranch
\item flattenBranch
\item pruneBranch
\item splitGen

\end{itemize}

Approaches based on neural networks need a very controlled format of data and big training datasets. The encoded genotype format of GenoMus can represent any piece of music as a simple unidimensional sequence of normalized floats, which can be profitable for techniques as recurrent neural networks (ref. to LMSTD), able to learn patterns from sequential streams of data.

The artistic results of every algorithm designed for automated composition
are strongly constrained by their own representation
system of musical data. This paper presents GenoMus, a
framework for the exploration of artificial musical creativity
based on a generative grammar focused on the abstraction
of creative processes as a metalevel of compositional
tasks. We define musical genotypes as functional
nested expressions, and phenotypes as the pieces created
by evaluating these computable expressions. GenoMus' grammar is designed 
to ease the combination of fundamental procedures behind very different styles, ranging from basic to complex contemporary
techniques, particularly those able to produce rich
output from very simple recursive algorithms. At the same
time, maximal modularity is provided to simplify metaprogramming
routines to generate, assess, transform and categorize
the selected musical excerpts. The system is conceived
to maintain a long term interrelation with different
users achieving individual musical styles. This proposed
grammar can also be an analytic tool, from the point of
view of composition as computation, considering that the
best analysis of a piece is the shortest precise description.

Cuestiones interesantes: 
\begin{itemize}
\item ?Cuantas funciones primitivas son necesarias para generar musica en un determinado estilo? Hay innumerables expresiones funcionales diferentes que pueden generar la misma musica. Se puede deducir que la expresion funcional mas breve es el mejor analisis. Se pueden ver diferentes paradigmas de ensenanza/aprendizaje de la musica con estos modelos.
\item ?Como puede hacerse ingenieria inversa automatizada para extraer estructuras desde la musica?
