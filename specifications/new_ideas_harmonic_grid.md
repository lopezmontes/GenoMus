# New ideas for the harmonic grid

The output of a harmonic function is an array of pitches, that is, a **harmonic grid**. Any pitches of an score, voice, etc. will be translated to the nearest value of the grid.

Elements defining a harmonic grid:

- **tuning**: tuning system applied as the main basis. This is the total pitches that can be used to define scales. 
- **scale**: subset of eligible pitches from the tuning system to construct modes.
- **mode**: subset of eligible pitches from the scale to construct chords.
- **chord**: subset of eligible pitches from the scale to define the harmonic grid.
- **root**: first pitch defining the transposition of the chord that will be used for the grid.
- **octavation**: amount of octaves to replicate the transposed chord. It can be also negative and not integer. 0 means that only the original chord will be used, without transposition.

Example of the data defining a harmonic grid:

```
{
    tuning: [], // all microtonal pitches are allowed as basis
    scale: [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11], // only integer MID notes are allowed
    mode: [0,2,4,5,7,9,11], // Major scale
    chord: [0,4,7], // Major chord
    root: 48, // MIDI note for the root
    octavation: 2 // repeat across 2 octaves the main chord
}
```

Harmonic grid generated by this input data:

```
[48,52,55,60,64,67,72,76,79]
```

Example of genotype code including a harmonic grid:

```
hCmajor(
    lEqualTemperament(),
    lNatural
)
