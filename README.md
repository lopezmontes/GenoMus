# GenoMus
The goal of this project is the exploration of artificial creativity applied to music composition.

GenoMus is a computer assisted composition project based on metaprogramming of procedural musical genotypes. Each genotype is a functional expression in JavaScript. The evaluation of these expressions produces music excerpts (or phenotypes). Both genotypes and phenotypes are encoded as unidimensional normalized vectors, which is convenient to apply different machine learning techniques. 

GenoMus is based on JavaScript and Max, via Node.js. The bach (bach automated composer's helper) package is also used to visualize the musical output of GenoMus. Seeded random number generator by David Bau is also needed. See this project here: https://github.com/davidbau/seedrandom

A webpage of a very preliminary prototype of GenoMus (in Spanish), with documentation and an sketch of the project in JavaScript, can be found at http://www.lopezmontes.es/genomus.html
