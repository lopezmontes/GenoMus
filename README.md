# GenoMus
GenoMus is a computer assisted creativity project based on metaprogramming of procedural musical genotypes.

The goal of this project is the exploration of artificial creativity applied to music composition.

GenoMus is based on JavaScript and Max, via Node.js. The bach (bach automated composer's helper) package is also used to visualize the musical output of GenoMus.

A webpage of a very preliminary prototype of GenoMus (in Spanish), with documentation and an sketch of the project in JavaScript, can be found at http://www.lopezmontes.es/genomus.html
